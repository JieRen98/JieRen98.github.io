Education
======

* Ph.D. in CS, KAUST, 2023 -- Present
* B.S. in EE, Xidian University, 2017 -- 2021

Experiences
======

* May 2025 -- August 2025
  * Baidu, China
  * Mentor: [Prof Haifeng Wang, CTO](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jgy4jCAAAAAJ)
  * Role: ERNIE Star Research Intern (「文心·新星」顶尖技术人才计划)
  * Duties included: I developed optimized int2 GPU kernels leveraging the stream-k algorithm, with pipelined memory loading, dequantization, and GEMM operations. This implementation achieved a 5x performance improvement over the Triton baseline. Additionally, for an AI for Science initiative (a CFD project optimizing aerodynamics for China's high-speed trains), I redesigned the computational pipeline and implemented custom kernels. These optimizations delivered a 3x speedup while reducing memory usage by 50%.

* July 2024 -- October 2024
  * NVIDIA, US
  * Mentor: [Dr Nic McDonald](https://www.nicm.dev/)
  * Role: Research Intern
  * Duties included: Implementing and profiling the communication-computation overlap distributed GEMM for next generation NVIDIA hardware and software systems.

* February 2023 -- October 2023
  * ETH Zurich, Switzerland
  * Supervisor: [Prof Torsten Hoefler](http://htor.inf.ethz.ch/)
  * Role: Academic Guest (funded by HiPEAC Grant)
  * Duties included: Investigating in sparse linear solver and 4bit quantization for transformer.
