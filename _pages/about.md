I am currently pursuing a MS/PhD program at KAUST in Saudi Arabia, under the guidance of [Prof. David E. Keyes](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/david-keyes). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering at Xidian University, China, in 2021.

My current research focuses on the co-design of scientific applications (e.g., PDEs, least squares), middleware (e.g., sparse solvers), and high-performance hardware (e.g., GPGPUs). Additional interests include operating systems, computer architecture, and artificial intelligence.

I've cultivated a deep understanding of NVIDIA GPU architectures. Additionally, I possess comprehensive knowledge of the source code and key implementation details of various open-source libraries, such as PyTorch and CUTLASS, and I have actively contributed to several of these projects.
